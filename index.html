                        <strong> <small>My Journey Till Now</small></strong>

                        <p>I am originally from the panhandle of Texas where my early childhood and teen life was spent.
                            <br> 
                        Amarillo Texas was a small town when I was there but has exploded in the last few years in population. 
                            <br>
                        in my early 20's I moved to Austin to begin a new chapter of my life, I descovered a lot about myself there!
                            <br>
                        I am an avid rock climber and gamer. I love playing guitar and eating at new places with my girlfriend and friends. 
                            <br>
                        my philosophy is we are all live in a finite space and time. So I used my time there letting go of my past and leaning into the future.

                <h1>My Soberiety</h1>
                <strong> <small>Starting in January of 2021 I began one of the hardest phases of my life.
                    <br>
                    Being completely sober from drugs and alcohol.
                    <br> 
                    Wondering if I was even capable of doing it, I struggled for long periods of time.
                    <br>
                    I couldnt decided if it was what I truly wanted for myself, ultimatly I stayed clean and never looked back!
                    <br>
                    It's been almost 18 months and I have not touch a substance or alcohol in that time.
                    <br>
                    This action spawned a new mind set, that with deication and passion I can do anyting I put my mind to.

                     I want to learn code to develop a better understanding of how computer software works.
